# Welcome to FSE171162

A project to learn and understand python (and also    
GitHub in the process)    

To get a copy of the code in this [repository][a], you're    
going to have to [pull][1] to your machine. Make yourself    
a [branch][2] to [commit][3] to too.    

### Here are a bunch of links to help you get started:     

- A [quick video](https://youtu.be/w3jLJU7DT5E "YouTube link you see") on how GitHub works    
- A [website](https://git-scm.com/ "Not a shady site I promise") of Git(the thing GitHub is built on)     
- A [guide to Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git "This website is for BitBucket but since it's Git it works"), the version control system
